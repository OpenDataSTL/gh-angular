    Maybe you have a ticket but canâ€™t afford the fines and fees. Spending time doing community service can be an alternative to paying for some traffic violations, as long as the judge agrees.
  </p>
  <p>
    If, when you see the judge, he/she agrees to a community service option in lieu of fines, it will be your responsibility to contact the Community Service agency, arrange for the community service time and date with them, and then bring back proof of your service to the judge.
