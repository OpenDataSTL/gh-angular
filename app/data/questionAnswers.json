     "a":"You’ve just discovered that you have a warrant for your arrest. NOW what?\n\nFirst, don’t panic. We can help you get started.\n\nThere are several reasons you may have an outstanding warrant, such as a missed court date or unpaid fines and fees. Regardless of why there is a warrant, it must be resolved.\n\nAll outstanding warrants must be discussed with the judge of the municipality that issued the ticket. For example, if Florissant issued the warrant, but Chesterfield issued a second traffic violation, you must see the judge in Florissant about the warrant and the judge in Chesterfield about the second traffic violation. Rest assured, you will not automatically be arrested when showing up to court to resolve a warrant.\n\nYou must contact the court clerk to schedule time with the judge. Showing up to court without being on the docket is not permitted. The clerk’s phone number is available on your ticket’s citations page. Click here to find your ticket on YourSTLCourts.\n\nAt court, explain your situation to the judge. Come prepared to pay some fines and fees. Many times, the judge is willing to work with citizens to resolve an outstanding warrant. They understand that compounded fines and fees result in a situation that is unaffordable for most people. Ask about a payment plan or a one-time payment that is affordable in order to clear your case and warrant.\n\nIf you need legal assistance, click here (link) to contact an attorney.",
