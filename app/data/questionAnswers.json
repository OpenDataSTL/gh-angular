     "a":"You’ve just discovered that you have a warrant for your arrest. NOW what?\n\nFirst, don’t panic. We can help you get started.\n\nThere are several reasons you may have an outstanding warrant, such as a missed court date or unpaid fines and fees.\n\nAll outstanding warrants must be resolved with the judge of the municipality that issued the ticket. Rest assured that when you show up to court to resolve a warrant with the judge, you will not automatically be arrested if you have outstanding warrants in other municipalities.\n\nYou must contact the court clerk to schedule time with the judge. Showing up to court without a slot on the docket is not permitted. The court's phone number is listed on your ticket information page.\n\nOnce at court, explain your situation to the judge. Be prepared to pay your fines and fees or work out an alternative plan with the judge. The judge is willing to work with you to resolve an outstanding warrant. They understand that compounded fines and fees often result in a situation that is unaffordable for some people. Ask about community service, a payment plan or a one-time payment that is affordable in order to clear your case and warrant.\n\nIf you need legal assistance, you should contact an attorney.",
